# CronManager

Create and run cronjobs within the manager

### Requirements

* MODX Revolution 2.6+
* PHP 5.6+

### Features

The CronManager for MODx makes it possible to execute snippets by the crontab
of the server. By using the manager of MODx Revolution you can simply add new
snippets to the cron list.

Using snippets for your cron management also requires properties and you can add
properties manually by setting up key value pairs but also with a propertyset
(name).
