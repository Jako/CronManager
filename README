What is Cron Manager

The cron manager for MODx makes it possible to execute snippets by the crontab of the server. 
Via the manager of MODx Revolution you could simple add new snippets to the cron list.

Using snippets for your cron management also requires properties and you can add properties 
manually by setting up key value pairs but also with a propertyset (name).
